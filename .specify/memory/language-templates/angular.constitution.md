### Component Placement Rules

1. **Child components belong inside the parent's folder.**
   Any component created specifically for one parent component lives in a `components/` subfolder inside that parent's directory. The `components/` subfolder should only be created if the parent directory is a feature directory. Otherwise, just create the component directly inside the parent's directory without creating `components/` subfolder

2. **Feature-level sharing → `<feature>/components/` shared folder.**
   If a component or service is used by more than one component within the same feature, move it to a `shared/` folder inside that feature folder.

3. **Cross-feature sharing → `src/app/shared/`.**
   If a component, service, or helper is used across two or more features it must be moved into the global `shared/` folder. Standalone components are imported directly where needed — no SharedModule.

4. **Stores folder management**
   Shared states accross features should be declared inside `app/store/` folder. All states exclusive to features should be declared at `<feature>/store/`. There should be no other store folder created on component level.

## Standalone Components

- All components, directives, and pipes must have `standalone: true`
- No NgModules — use `app.config.ts` for all global providers
- Each component imports its own dependencies in its `imports: []` array
- No SharedModule — shared components are imported directly where needed

## Always use TDD approach (Test Driven Development)

When creating services, components, helpers, etc. Always create the test first based on the acceptance criteria before starting the actual task. Always consider the edge cases when creating tests. It should have 100% coverage.

## CODING CONVENTIONS

### Should follow Global standards

- If rules are not defined here, always consider the global standards first when coding.
- It should follow a self-documenting code mindset.

### Dealing with magic numbers/words/conditions

TODO: Add more description here

Magic numbers/words/conditions are those constant numbers/words/conditions that we have no context what they represent.
Sample:

- All magic numbers should be assigned to a constant variable with a name that describes it

### Code Arrangements via Access Modifiers

For variables, functions, lifecycle methods, etc. Follow the arrangement below:

```
// Inputs
// Outputs
// Public variables
// Private variables
// Constructor
// Lifecycle methods
// Public methods
// Private methods
```

### Styling

- Always consider responsiveness. It should look good on all screens be it a pc, tablet, or mobile
- All colors and constants should be defined on `src/assets/styles/variables.scss`
- All shared mixins should be defined on `src/assets/styles/mixins.scss`
- All re-used global styles should be defined on `src/assets/styles/global.scss`.
- Absolutely no inline styling.

## Naming Conventions

- **Interfaces**: no prefix — use `User`, `ApiResponse` (not `IUser`, `IApiResponse`)
- **Enums**: PascalCase for name and members
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for module-level constants
- **Files**: kebab-case for all filenames

## Testing

- **Framework**: Jest (not Karma/Jasmine)
- Always TDD: write the test first based on acceptance criteria
- 100% coverage enforced via Jest coverage thresholds in `jest.config.js`
- Ensure that the 100% coverage thresholds is achieved
- Cover all edge cases
- Use Angular Testing Library alongside `TestBed` for component tests

## Code Quality

- **ESLint** with `@angular-eslint` required on all projects
- **Prettier** for formatting (enforced via `eslint-plugin-prettier`)
- No exceptions: all committed code must pass lint and format checks

## Accessibility (a11y)

- Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- All interactive elements must have accessible labels (`aria-label` or visible text)
- All images must have meaningful `alt` attributes
- Keyboard navigation must work without a mouse
- Never rely solely on color to convey meaning

## HTTP Interceptors

- All interceptors live in `src/app/shared/interceptors/`
- `auth.interceptor.ts`: attaches auth token to outgoing requests
- `error.interceptor.ts`: handles global HTTP error responses (logging, user-facing messages)
- Register via `provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([authInterceptor, errorInterceptor]))` in `app.config.ts`

## Technical Preferences

- **_Styling:_** SCSS
- **_State Management:_** NgRx (Classic: Actions / Reducers / Effects)
- **_Reactivity:_**
  - Signals in components: use `input()`, `output()`, `signal()`, `computed()` in components
  - Use `toSignal()` to consume NgRx selectors inside components — no `async` pipe
  - Keep NgRx store, effects, and services as pure RxJS / Observables
- **_Change Detection:_** `OnPush` on every component — no exceptions
- **_Forms:_** Reactive Forms only (`FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, `FormControl`)
- **_Template Syntax:_** Always use `@if` / `@for` / `@switch` — never `*ngIf` / `*ngFor`
